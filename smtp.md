### SMTP
- SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used to send email messsages between serers and email clients. SMTP is a key component of email communication and is responsible for ensuring that messages are delivered to their intended recipients.
- SMTP works by allowing an email client to connect to an SMTP server and send an email message to a recipient's email addresss. The SMTP server then checks to make sure that the recipient's email addresss is valid and that the message is not spam. If everthing checks out, the smtp server delivers the message to the recipient's email server, which in turn delivers the message to the recipient's email client.
